#An interactive form [WIP]
Allows the user to upload content and preview the final result before submitting.

To test it load *index.php* on your browser.

In order to properly see the php, it must be delivered from a server with php support. If you don't have one already you can install [apache](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/install.html).
